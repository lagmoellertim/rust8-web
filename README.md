## Introduction

Welcome to **Rust8 Web**, a high-performance online CHIP-8 emulator. This project leverages the power of Rust for the core emulation logic, WebAssembly (WASM) to bring classic CHIP-8 games and applications to the modern web and React to give you a pretty web interface. Rust8 Web is based on [Rust8](https://github.com/lagmoellertim/rust8), a Rust library designed for CHIP-8 emulation.
